## ‚ú®The best way to pay for a lovely moment is to enjoy it.
It was a time in my life when I was forgotten to enjoy the precious moment of my life. Someone came to my life and taught me to enjoy all the moments of my life, even the worst ones and the hard ones. We don‚Äôt know in the world there are a lot of people who are struggling more than us, who are living in poverty and hunger. Maybe we are far from our loved ones but there are people who lost their loved ones forever. 


Since I was a child I had the sense of humanity and sympathy to those who are living in hunger, back then I had no idea of life circumstance, what I knew was one day I will be able to help the people who don‚Äôt have enough to eat. Specially children.


Therefore, I decide to do something to produce healthy, cheap food (even free for those who cannot buy). With the idea of ( **Mobile Restaurant**) which can make job opportunities, culture exchange, providing free food once per week or month (based on income) for refugees and the people who are living in bad conditions on the streets or dont have access to healthy food around the world.


_Poverty_ is something that I have been through in my childhood, I have well understanding of the feeling when your father disappointedly says **‚ÄúI am not able to find food for my children they have to find by themselves‚Äù**. I was seven years old when I start making rugs and carpets instead of going to school, playing in park and hanging out with friends. Although, it was a hard time for me as well as for my family but I was enjoying being to gather with my siblings and my parents. Still I remember when we were making fun of something and start laughing and couldn‚Äôt stop üòÑ. I remember the winters nights when my father was reading stories of ‚ú® **Shahnama** ‚ú® and poems of ‚ú® **Bedel Dehlawi** ‚ú®. Now I am thankful of the lessons I learned at that time, and having the beautiful memories with my loved ones.


**About myself:** my name is Tahmina I am a refugee from ‚ú® _Afghanistan_ ‚ú®, currently I am living in a refugee center. I am learning web development with [Hack Your Future Belgium](https://hackyourfuture.be/). I am very glad for having this opportunity to study and follow my dreams in this county. And I am really grateful of [HYF](https://hackyourfuture.be/) program for providing this opportunity. I have a big hope to make my dreams come true and this is the fastest steps toward my dreams and goals.
